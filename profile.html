        Hello from Dublin! Yesterday I had the privilege of attending KatsConf2, a functional programming conference put on by the fun-loving, welcoming, and crazy-well-organized @FunctionalKats. It was a whirlwind of really exciting talks from some of the best speakers around. Here’s a glimpse into what I learned.

There’s no such thing as an objectively perfect programming language: all languages make tradeoffs. But it is possible to find/design a language that’s more perfect for you and your project’s needs.
Automation, automation, automation:
Generative programming lets you write high-level code that generates low-level code
Program derivation and synthesis let you write specifications/tests and leave it to the computer to figure out the code
(Boring!) code rewriting tasks can be automated too
Relational programming, Total programming and Type-Driven Development are (cool/mindblowing) things.
You can do web programming with FP - and interestingly, even in a total language like Idris.
I took a bunch of notes during the talks, in case you’re hungering for more details. But @jessitron took amazing graphical notes that I’ve linked to in the talks below, so just go read those!

And for the complete experience, check out this storify Vicky Twomey-Lee, who led a great ally skills workshop the evening before the conference, made of the #KatsConf2 tweets:
